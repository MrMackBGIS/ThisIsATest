  ## Practice Questions: Printing to the Screen


  In this exercise, you will practice using basic print statements in your
  chosen programming language. These questions are designed to help you
  understand how to output text to the screen, a fundamental skill in
  programming.


  ### Questions


  1. **Basic Print Statement**
     - Write a program that prints the following text to the screen: "Hello, World!"

  2. **Printing Variables**
     - Declare a variable named `greeting` and assign it the value "Welcome to Computer Science!".
     - Print the value of the `greeting` variable to the screen.

  3. **Concatenating Strings**
     - Create two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and assign them your first and last names, respectively.
     - Print a message to the screen that says "Hello, [firstName] [lastName]!" by concatenating the variables.

  4. **Using Escape Characters**
     - Write a program that prints the following text, including the quotation marks: "Programming is fun!"
     - Use escape characters to include the quotation marks in your output.

  5. **Printing Numbers**
     - Declare a variable `age` and assign it your age.
     - Print a message to the screen that says "I am [age] years old."

  ### Tips


  - Remember to use the correct syntax for print statements in your programming
  language.

  - Pay attention to details like spaces and punctuation in your output.

  - Test your code to ensure it produces the expected output.


  By completing these exercises, you'll gain confidence in using print
  statements to display information, a crucial step in learning to program.
